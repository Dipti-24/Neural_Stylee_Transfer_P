**Neural Style Transfer with VGG19**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project demonstrates Neural Style Transfer (NST) using a pre-trained VGG19 model in Keras. Neural Style Transfer allows you to blend the content of one image with the style of another, creating an entirely new artistic image that retains the structure of the content image while adopting the visual appearance of the style image.

**🚀 Features**

📸 Content Preservation: Maintains the structure of the original image.
🎨 Style Application: Applies artistic textures from another image.
🔧 Customizable Parameters: Adjust content/style weights for different effects.
⚡ Pre-trained VGG19 Model: Uses a well-trained network for feature extraction.

**🏗️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites**
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed along with the required dependencies.

**Steps to Run the Project**

**1.Clone the repository**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-style-transfer.git  
cd neural-style-transfer  
**2. Install dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt  
**3. Run the script**
python style_transfer.py --content content.jpg --style style.jpg --output result.jpg  
**4.View the output**
The generated image will be saved as result.jpg.

**🔬 How It Works**
The VGG19 model is used to extract content and style representations from the input images.
The content image contributes the structural elements, while the style image provides artistic textures.
An optimization process minimizes the difference between the output and the content/style representations.

**🔮 Future Enhancements**
🎭 Multiple Style Transfer: Combine multiple styles into one output image.
⚡ Real-time Processing: Optimize the model for faster, real-time style transfer.
🌐 Web Interface: Develop a Streamlit/Flask web app for easy image uploads and style transfer.
